# This file specifies what gets built and how, in a way independent of the particular
# "build system" being used.

# The source tree follows these rules
# - all source files are expected to be built as part of the library where they live
# - all source files depend on headers of the place they are in, and places occuring earlier
# - all programs have a main/top file with the suffix _main
# - all programs depend on the library of the place they are in, statically, and earlier libs
# - all programs and libraries can use all runtime prereq libraries

# The syntax of describing places is one line per place, with blank lines and # comments ok

# Specifying places: (source subtrees)
# Places are specified one per line, with directory pathname followed by options
# Default behavior for a place is:
# - library name is basename of pathname (with ocpi_ prefix)
# - resulting library is an exported runtime library, installed in "<platform>/lib"
# - resulting library is OpenCPI code subject to strict warnings etc.
# - resulting library should be available to later libraries and programs (lines after it)
# - any programs found are exported to "<platform>/bin"

# Options (after source tree pathname) are to change the default behavior:
# -l <name>: the library name is not the basename of the directory, but this name
# -n: library is not installed, and is only static, used for programs in the same place
# -f: library is "foreign", built with less strict options since its not OpenCPI code
# -d <dir>: installation subdirectory for programs (under <platform>/bin), default is none
# -D <XX=YY>: value is cpp definition for use when building the library
# -v: library is a driver/plugin
# -I <dir>: value is other dir to look for headers, relative to top of source tree
# -t: library and programs are "tools" not "runtime" and thus depend on subset of runtime libs,
#     will not be built for cross-compiled targets, and not used by runtime programs
# -x <pattern>: source files to ignore in the place
# -s: library members have static constructors and are not necessarily referenced
#     This causes programs to be build with the place's object files, not its library
# -T <program>: a top-level program, overriding the -d <dir> default for programs in the place
# -L <library>: access a library that would not normally be accessible from tools

# There are several "special" lines:
# 1. "prerequisites" which is a list of the *runtime* prerequisite libraries
# 2. "end-of-runtime-for-tools", which marks the end of the runtime libraries usable by tools

# We know, when building:
# 1. The platform we are building (default is the current build machine)
# 2. Whether it is a development platform or a runtime-only platform (default is development)
# 3. Whether it is cross compiled or not (default is not cross compiled)

 *
 * 2. The place for compiler-sensitive definitions that are NOT determined by autoconf.
 *
 * This file is included by ocpi-config.h (which is what source files include), and it is
 * protected by the guard in ocpi-config.h.  That file is generated in the conventional way
 * by autoconf.
 *
 * ocpi-config.h is included by source files who need to be aware of the "configuration",
 * whether that configuration is autotools generated or ad hoc with compiler version ifdefs etc.
 * This file is never included directly.

 *
 * This is to support gcc on CentOS 6, gcc on CentOS 7, and clang on C7.
 * The MSC stuff in here is legacy, but no reason to remove it at this time.
 *
 * clang declares itself to be gcc 4.2 when using __GNUC__ and __GNUC_MINOR__.
 * gcc on C6 declares __cplusplus to be "1" instead of "199711"
 * ( https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1773 ), even when told "c++0x"
 * gcc on C7 declares __cplusplus to be "199711" normally, "c++0x" and "c++11" both
 * give "201103"
 * clang supports "nullptr" only if given "-std=c++0x", but defines __cplusplus
 * to be "201103" for both c++0x and c++11, and "199711" with no options.
 * So, to make a long story short, if __cplusplus is > 199711, nullptr should be defined.

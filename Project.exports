# THIS IS NOT A PROJECT EXPORTS FILE EVEN THOUGH IT IS SIMILAR
# There are implicit links based on "places", with rules described below.
# + lines means additions to cdk development package
# = lines means additions to cdk runtime and development packages
# - lines means remove links implied by other rules
#
# The "places" rules are about framework headers, libraries, and programs.
# In general, programs go in bin, libraries and swigs go in lib, API headers go into include/aci
#
# For runtime, only driver/plugin libraries go in lib, (and later, dynamic libraries)
# For runtime, tool programs are not exported.
# For programs, they can specify a subdirectory of bin.  If that subdirectory is "internal",
# they are not exported at all.
#
# There are other "final" actions that happen during this export:
# - compile python programs and scripts

# exclusions, sometimes only applying to categories
#-runtime/util main
#-runtime/dataplane main

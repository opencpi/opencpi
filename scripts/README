These scripts are those that are run at the top level of the opencpi source tree that are not
part of the CDK.  They are generally used for installing software or initializing the environment
when building the core software in the source tree.

I.e. scripts are here that are never exported in the CDK and thus not needed by users
(only core OpenCPI maintainers or developers of new software platforms)

Many of these scripts are here for historical reasons, since build-oriented scripts have been
moved to the build/ subdirectory and packaging-oriented scripts have moved to the
packaging/ directory.

At this time these scripts are still used:
  init-opencpi.sh: initialize the environment in the source tree when it is virgin
  install-opencpi.sh: do everything at once in a source tree, see below
  makeExportLinks.sh: populate the exports directory to define what is in the CDK
  test-opencpi.sh: run all or some tests

The top-level script, install-opencpi.sh does the the following things, with its optional
first argument being the software platform to build for.

-- install required external package-repository software packages for the platform
---- using the install-packages.sh script
-- download/build OpenCPI prerequisite packages (for its own use, including cross-compiled)
---- using the install-prerequisites.sh script
-- build the OpenCPI framework libraries and executable
-- build the software aspects of the built-in projects
---- both using the build-opencpi.sh script
-- (on development platforms) run a set of tests that test various aspects of opencpi
---- using the test-opencpi.sh script

The install-opencpi.sh script without arguments does its job for the currently running platform.
With its first argument set to a software platform name, it builds for that platform.
If that is not the currently running platform, it is essentially doing its work for
a cross-compiled (probably embedded) platform, in which case the final test step is not
performed.

This cdk directory contains tools and makefile scripts that comprise
the cdk.

The "export" subdirectory is a directory of hand-create
simlinks, NOT SOURCE FILES, that can be tar'd to export the cdk.

The top level "include" directory contains make scripts, and other
constant files.  Tools are in their own subdirectories built normally,
starting with ocpigen.  The target directory names for the cdk are
based on the `uname -s`-`uname -m` formula, while the overall OCPI
build files use things like linux-bin and macos-bin.  The export link
tree converts one to the other.

Thus the export tree is expected to be copied into a real
"installation" tree that might include stuff build from other areas.

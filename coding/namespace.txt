All our code should be in the OCPI namespace (some still isn't).  We
should not use "using namespace" since it means that you are using a
lower layer, and the maintainer of the lower layer needs to be able to
introduce names in their namespace without knowing whether it will
collide with ALL CALLERS.  Perhaps "using std" isn't bad since we know
what is there, but "std::" is pretty short...

So, in header files use full namespace names.
Never introduce namespace abbreviations in header files since callers need control of their own
abbreviations.
In source files, use abbreviations as convenient.  Typical ones are:

namesoace OS = OCPI::OS;
namespace OU = OCPI::Util;

In general use prefixes already used for the same things.  Use "grep 'namespace * OCPI::'"

In source files enclose the code in a namespace scope so that code
isn't littered redundantly with the local namespace.  E.g.

namespace OCPI {
 namespace DataTransport {

classes and methods in the OCPI::DataTransport namespace.....

}
}

[Need more rules for how the internal namespaces under OCPI correspond
to the directory structure.]

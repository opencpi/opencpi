Scripts (not C++ main programs) fall into several categories, but are generally placed in
tools/cdk/scripts (soon to become tools/scripts).

Scripts that are exposed to users must follow these rules:
==========================================================

1. the tool name should start with "ocpi" to control path namespace pollution.
   Try to fit it in so it is similar to other "ocpixxx" commands and appears to be part of the
   same environment rather than an outlier.

2. any language suffix should not be present so that the documented use of the tool does not
   depend upon its implementation language - the file in "scripts" can have the suffix,
   but it cannot be exported or documented with it.  I.e. if you write ocpifoo.py or ocpifoo.sh,
   export it as ocpifoo.

3. scripts should be exported to bin directories so they are available in the user's path
   with only a single directory added by OpenCPI.  The "scripts" directory is not put into
   user paths and may contain internal scripts not intended for users.

4. command arguments should attempt to follow the same conventions used for C++ executables.
e.g.:
 single hyphen options are single letters
 double hyphen options should be hyphen-separated words, not abbreviations
    except things like "init", etc. (we should have a list of some common abbreviations).
 when the command does multiple things, the first non-option arg should be a "verb" saying
 what sub-command is being invoked.
 arguments after the options and verb are verb-specific, but are usually "nouns".

 option arguments should try to follow the pattern of other commands, like -v for verbose etc.
 (some of these will become automatically included in the future).

5. scripts should clean up after themselves on control-c unless there is an explicit "keep"
   option.

6. scripts, like executables, should issue the help message and return an exit status of 1 when
   invoked with no arguments.  I.e. issuing the command with no arguments is "safe".

(todo: temp file common conventions)
(todo: we don't yet have a standard bash equivalent to the command executable options capability).

Scripts not documented for users and only used by other scripts:
================================================================

These should not be exported to bin, and should not be accessed without explicit reference to
their exported location in OCPI_CDK_DIR, i.e. is $OCPI_CDK_DIR/scripts/foo.

These can have any language suffix.

Shell scripts are written for two distinct environments:
========================================================

When they are for use in a development environment, they may make full use of bash, but should
generally use the --noprofile option to avoid being affected by user shell settings.

When they are for a target/embedded/runtime environment, they should stick to the basic POSIX
shell capabilities and NOT use BASH features not supported by many small embedded shell
implementations.
(todo: What was that script that tested for non-posix features?)
(todo: add stuff that doesn't work on things like busybox/ash etc.)

A comment at the top of embedded scripts should make it VERY CLEAR that the script is for
limited/embedded environments so that maintainers don't trash it unwittingly by adding use
of BASH features.

Python:
=======

The availability of python 2.x can be assumed in development environments, but not (yet) in
embedded environments.

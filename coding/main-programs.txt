Main programs should be in source files whose name is <command>_main.{cxx,cc}
See the scripts.txt file for command naming.

The CmdOption.h system of command option parsing should be used.  This will force the behavior
where a help message is generated and exit status is 1, when the command is issued with no
arguments.

This option parsing system allows for typed values consistent with the data typing system
in OpenCPI, used in properties etc.  Only scalar types are allowed, but when the option
is specified as allowing multiple values, the value of the option is a an array of the
specified options.  See command-options.txt

Executables should return zero on success and non-zero on failure.

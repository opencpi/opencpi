There are (at least) these categories of names that have some degree of standardization.
There is a distinciton between names visible to non-programmer "users", and coders.

At least briefly, they are captured here.

Source Code file names
-- C++ 
   The intention is to move to "*.cc" and "*.hh", but for now it is "*.cxx" and "*.h".
   These will be shorter, like OmniOrb, and hh makes it clear that the editing mode for the file
   should be C++, not c.  User visible C++ files (workers) are already .cc etc.

   Generally camel-case to match classes, with the first word being the namespace
   of the directory of source files, which usually matches the directory name
   which will be lower case.
   E.g. the file name ContainerPort.{cxx,cc,h,hh} would be in the directory named "container",
   and in the namespace OCPI::Container

   When file names do not match classes and namespaces they may just be categories of code,
   and may be named more flexibly, and since they don't correspond to names of things
   in the source code, may use hyphens.

-- C++ header files
   Similar to source code except for API headers.
   API headers, which will be used by external development are distinguished two ways:
   1. There must be a Ocpi prefix to the file name reflecting the global namespace.
   2. The end of the name before the suffix should be Api to unambiguously designate the file
      as apropriate for export and for API use (and for documentation).
   Note that OcpiApi.hh is the "master API file" that should generally include all others.

-- main programs
   <program_name>_main.cxx where program names are usually ocpi<program> in lower case.
   These names (ocpi<program>) will be thus command names.

XML file names
   The .xml suffix is used uniformly.
   Some files use a suffix after a hyphen when the suffix is not part of the name of the 
   thing being described in the file.  Two common ones are "-spec.xml" and "-prot.xml".
   Hyphens are used to make it clear that this is a type suffix, and not part of the name.

worker/platform/configuration/container names (before prefix) in xml
   lower case with underscore word separators.

C++ Namespace names
   All start in the OCPI namespace. (There are exceptions that will go away).
   If it is an abbreviation (like HDL, etc.) it is all upper case. If not, camelcase.

C++ type/class names
   Capitalized camelcase.

C++ names: the theory/puspose being you know by looking what it is.
-- globals
   g_ prefix
-- statics (not in class)
   no prefix, initial lower camelcase - i.e. not distinguished from member functions
-- constants
   c_ prefix for member data in a class.
   All upper case for globals (like MACROS)
-- Enumeration values
   Usually all upper case.  Sometimes <UPPER_PREFIX>_<lower>.
-- MACROS
   All upper case.
-- static member data
   s_ prefix
-- static member functions
   initial-lower-camelcase - not distinguished from non-static member functions.
-- member data
   m_ prefix
-- member functions
   initial-lower-camelcase
-- arguments to functions and methods
   Usually initial-lower-camelcase, but sometimes with an a_ prefix (analogous to m_ ),
   to simply avoid shadowing.
-- local variables
   Usually initial-lower-camelcase, but sometimes with a l_ prefix (analogous to m_),
   to simply avoid shadowing.

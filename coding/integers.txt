This note describes the principles behind the use and choice of
integer types.  While the broad goal would be to use proper typedefs
for all sorts of types for maximum type safety, the practice used
falls somewhere in the middle.

In general, we use unsigned types when there is no need for negative
values.  A few exceptions are using signed types for "bit flags",
which is probably wrong.  Occasionally we use signed types simply to
have a sentinel (-1) along with an unsigned value.

We use size_t as a convenient unsigned type a lot since it is
consistent with many standard library calls (from strlen to STL size
and length).  On some systems it is "long" and on others it is not.
All the printf/scanf functions have convenient size codes for it
(using "z").  Without using it many common patterns can force an
implicit truncation, which we want to avoid.  This allows us to turn
on the -Wconversion warnings and not get buried with conversions from
"size_t", to "unsigned int".  size_t is used in OpenCPI user APIs also
to be consistent standard library and system APIs.  So size_t is
"sticky" if we use an API that returns it, we let the type size_t
propagate through code.  (e.g. strlen or size/length methods in STL)

In using STL we sometimes use std::streamsize, but size_t is the same.

Whenever we truly need to know the size of integers we use stdint.h
and its sized types, as well as intptr_t as needed.  But when there is
a possibility that we might change our minds about the sizes or need
to compile globally with different sizes we use a typedef.

When we knowingly are truncating an integer type we use
OCPI_UTRUNCATE(to-type,val) or OCPI_STRUNCATE for signed types.
This allows, in debug, a runtime check for these truncations.

Two particularly important types are:

OCPI::Util::ResAddr (or in older code OCPI::Util::ResAddrType) is used
for the offset within a managed resource pool.

DtOsDataTypes::Offset is used for the offset within a endpoint address
region.

sizeof(DtOsDataTypes::Offset) must be larger than sizeof(OCPI::Util::ResAddr).

Since we use C-style printf/sprintf/sscanf patterns a lot, we
generally define macros for printing these types, based on the
inttypes.h macros like PRIu32.  These macros are upper case with _ for
:: in namespaces, and the suffix like "_PRIu".

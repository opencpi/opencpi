Ordering of declarations/definitions within classes, and their naming conventions is:

class name camel case initial capitalized
types: camel case initial capitalized
constants: - upper case or c_
data members: - using m_
static member data: using s_
static member functions
constructors
destructors
private "init" methods (code shared among constructors)
private member functions
protected member functions
public member functions

static member functions sometimes belong next to something else, rather than
together before the contructors.

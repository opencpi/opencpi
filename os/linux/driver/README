This is the OpenCPI Linux Driver.

Requirements:

* GNU GCC toolset
* Source for your Linux Kernel
* sudo

OCPI_TARGET_KERNEL_DIR can be set for where the linux kernel is to build the driver against.
It is required for cross-compiling the driver
Note that for cross-compiling the driver you need to set:
OCPI_CROSS_BUILD_BIN_DIR and OCPI_CROSS_HOST and OCPI_TARGET_ARCH

To build the driver:

$ make

$ make load

******** MORE INFO ON KERNEL HEADER CREATION FOR A NEW VENDOR KERNEL ********
When using alternate kernels provided by hardware vendors, a full build of the kernel
is required when certain files such as Module.symvers are not provided.
To deal with this:

First, on the running system, extract the ".config" used by the vendor to build the
kernel on the device:

# zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
(copy file to local kernel source location)

Then, the following are performed:

 make clean
 make oldconfig
 make prepare
 make
 make modules

It is important to have the proper cross-compiling flags set in the environment.
To automate this, you can add the above lines to /os/linux/driver/Makefile
in the $(MODFILE) rule (with "cd $(KERNELDIR)").

After that, pare down the tree as much as possible before checking in. Some
low-hanging fruit include:
 - every subdir except arch/arm, include, scripts (keeping Kconfig from all)
 - *.o *.c *.cmd .tmp*
 - Any other binaries EXCEPT those found in scripts/
  - find . -type f -not -iname '*.h' -not -iname '*.c' -not -iname '*.S' -not -iname 'kconfig' | xargs file | grep ELF
 - arch/arm/boot and include/linux/{mfd,platform_data} (again, keeping Kconfig)

The idea is to approximate the "kernel headers" package normally distributed
by linux distributions. This can be assisted by using git to restore files as
they are needed, e.g: "rm -rf arch; git checkout -- arch/arm; git status | grep /Kconfig | grep -v debug | cut -f2 -d: | xargs git checkout --"
and between driver compilations "git clean -fdx" to force rebuilds.

********THE FOLLOWING MEMMAP FEATURE IS FOR X86 ARCHITECTURES ONLY******

If you want to use more then 128KB of RAM, then you will need to reserve a 
block of memory during the Linux kernel boot, using the memmap parameter.  The
memmap parameter takes a number of formats, but the one that is most useful to 
us is the following:

	memmap=SIZE$START

Where SIZE is the number of bytes to reserve in either hex or decimal, and
START is the physical address in hexidecimal bytes.  You *must* use even
page boundaries (0x1000 or 4096 bytes) for all addresses and sizes.  
  
Start by running:

$ dmesg | grep BIOS

 BIOS-e820: 00000000fffe0000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)

 You want to select a (usable) section of memory and reserve a section of that
 memory.  Once the memory is reserved, the Linux kernel will ignore it.  In
 this example, there are 3 useable sections:
 
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009f800 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 000000005fef0000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000005ff00000 - 0000000060000000 (usable)

Due to the way Linux manages memory, it is recommended you pick a higher 
address (above the first 24 bits).  The best choice is the second section 
(pages 0x100-0x5fef0).  If you wanted to reserve 128MB, that would be 
0x8000 pages.  Pick the end of the block (page 0x5fef0) and subtract the 
number of pages, leaving 0x57ef0.  This would result in the following memmap 
parameter:

	memmap=128M$0x57EF0000

Once you've calculated your memmap parameter, you will need to add it to the
kernel command line in your boot loader.

For CentOS 6 and 7, you can use the utility "grubby".

This will add the parameter to all kernels in the startup menu. The single
quotes are REQUIRED or your shell will interpret the $0:

sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args=memmap='128M$0x57EF0000'

CentOS 7 uses grub2, which requires a double backslash to not interpret it:

sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args=memmap='128M\\$0x57EF0000'

To verify the current kernel has the argument set:
sudo -v
sudo grubby --info $(sudo grubby --default-kernel)

CentOS 7 users should see a SINGLE backslash before the $.

To remove the parameter:
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args=memmap

More information concerning grubby can be found at:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sec-Making_Persistent_Changes_to_a_GRUB_2_Menu_Using_the_grubby_Tool.html

... the memmap parameter:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt

Note: If you have other memmap parameters, e.g. for non-OpenCPI PCI cards,
then grubby usage will be different. The OpenCPI driver will use the first
memmap parameter on the command line OR the parameter "opencpi_memmap" if it
is explicitly given. If this parameter is given, the standard memmap command
with the same parameters must ALSO be passed to the kernel.

Reboot the system, making certain to boot from your new configuration.
Once that's done, if you run 'dmesg' you should see something like this:

DMI present.

You will see a new (reserved) area between the second (useable) section and the
(ACPI data) section.

Now, when you run the 'make load' script, it will detect the new reserved
area, and pass that data to the opencpi kernel module.

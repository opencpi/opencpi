This directory contains files relating to packaging OpenCPI for distribution.
If the OpenCPI source tree is downloaded, built, and used in place, there is no
"distribution" and nothing in this directory will be used.

Since different target operating systems use different packaging systems, this directory
has some files that are generic - meaning used independent of which OS or packaging system
is used to make distributions for a given OS.

Of course the primary distribution system used for OpenCPI is RPM/YUM, which is used by CentOS,
RedHat, Fedora etc.

When we use the term "package" here, it is as RPM uses the term - which is an independently
installable package of files.   We currently have these packages for software platforms:

runtime
devel
driver

So when we "create a distribution package for software platform <platform>", we are creating
one of those packages, and creating the type of package appropriate for that platform.
Development packages for embedded platforms are prepared for the type of development host being
used.

The generic files here are:

prepare-package-list.sh:
   a script to generate the files that should be included in for a specified package

For RPM building we have:
   cdk.spec - the RPM spec file for creating the OpenCPI runtime and devel packages
   driver.spec - the RPM spec file for creating the OpenCPI driver package
   prepare-rpm-files.sh - a script used in the RPM spec files that essentially translates the
      generic output of the prepare-package-list.sh script into what the rpmbuild process needs,
      which is to have a list of files and directories, and make a private copy of all files.

   These may be moved to a subdirectory in the future

For each platform, distribution files will be placed in the target-<platform> subdirectory

FIXME: coregen->something more generic, same with NGC, etc.

This note describes the procedure for importing a generated core into
an opencpi primitive directory to be used as an OpenCPI primitive
core.  For Xilinx, generated cores typically come from "coregen".

There are a few things to do on the generated core side, and then a
simple task on the opencpi importing side.  The idea is to leave the
generated core directory alone with the exception of adding two files
in the top level to facilitate exporting the core into opencpi.  The
reason to have these files in the generated core tree as opposed to
the opencpi primitive core directory is that the core developer should
maintain them as the core might change, without really knowing
anything about how opencpi works.  Then on the opencpi side, there is
just a reference to the generated core directory such that the opencpi
primitive core directory can be easily "refreshed" from the generated
core side.

The only thing that is constant over the course of the possible
evolution on the generated core side is the directory location itself.
Thus updating the opencpi side from the generated core side is
trivial.  It is also possible to build the opencpi primitive core in a
subdirectory of the generated core if the developer wants to operate
that way.

Any source files that the author needs to modify (to "patch" the
generated core), must be present in the generated core
directory. (perhaps under a "patches" subdirectory, but that is not
mandatory).

Let's assume the generated core developer has the generated core
results in the directory /home/joe/AbcCore.  To enable the core to be
imported into opencpi as a primitive core, the developer needs to:

First of two files: create a file called opencpi-core.mk in /home/joe/AbcCore/opencpi-core.mk, containing "make" variable assignments (and comments starting with #, and wrapped/continued lines ending in \).

1. If the name of the core on the opencpi side is different from the
   name of its directory (in this case "AbcCore"), then the "Core" variable
   must be set in opencpi-core.mk (e.g. Core=abc).
2. If the top level module name of the core is NOT the same as the name
   of the core (the directory name or the name set by the "Core" variable),
   then the top module name is set by the "Top" variable (e.g. Top=abc_top).
3. If the core is prebuilt/presynthesized into an EDIF/NGC file, then that file
   is specified using the PreBuiltCore variable (e.g. PreBuiltCore=abc.ngc).
4. Specify source files needed to build or synthesize the core.  A prebuilt core
   will only have source files for simulation if any.  These files are set using
   the "SourceFiles" variable (e.g. SourceFiles=abc_top.v abc_inside.v).  These
   file names are relative to the top level generated core dirctory.

Second of two files: Create a "black box" empty module file containing the verilog module definition for the core, in the form (at least for Xilinx):

(* box_type="user_black_box" *)
module my_coreAbc
  # (<parameters...>) // if there are any parameters
  (<input, inout, output port defitions);
  port declarations
endmodule

The name of this black box module definition file is <top-module-name>_bb.v.

When the core is prebuilt without any verilog files (and thus only an
NGC file), there is usually a verilog file created for simulation that
can be easily used (copied and trimmed) to create the "black box"
file.  (VHDL developers can think of this file as containing the VHDL
component definition of the module).

So if Joe's core is called "filter", the simple case might be that it
is created in a directory /home/joe/filter, and assuming the top
module name is also "filter", there must be a filter_bb.v file in
/home/joe/filter, and an opencpi-core.mk file in /home/joe/filter whose
contents would be (assuming the source files needed to build the core
are filter_top.v and filter_innards.v):

SourceFiles=filter_top.v filter_innards.v

If the core was prebuilt and should NOT be built from source, the opencpi-core.mk
file would contain:

PreBuiltCore=filter.ngc

Finally, to specify which "build targets" are appropriate for the core
(which parts or part families), the "OnlyTargets" variable is set,
e.g.:

OnlyTargets=virtex5

or

OnlyTargets=xc6vlx240t

If the core can be built for a variety of targets EXCEPT certain targets that
should be excluded, then the "ExcludeTargets" variable can be used.
Any example might be:

OnlyTargets=virtex5
ExcludeTargets=xc5vsx95t

This would mean the core is suitable for all virtex5 parts except for xc5sx95t.

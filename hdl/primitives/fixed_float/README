This primitive library is just an extract from the libraries available at 
www.vhdl.org/fpvhdl.  There doesn't appear to be any licensing language associated with them,
thus we assume we are free to use them.
We have a copy to avoid whether some vendors supply the ieee_proposed and some don't.
We just use it for floating point converstions.
The changes we made is to call the library fixed_float rather than ieee_proposed,
and split the package declaration and package bodies into separate files,
per the rules for OpenCPI HDL primitive libraries (where the pkg declaration file must
end in "_pkg".

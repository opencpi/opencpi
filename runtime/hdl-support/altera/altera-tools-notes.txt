The standard quartus "subscription edition" installation is necessary for building bitstreams.

For runtime-only, you need the quartus "web" edition, NOT the "quartus programming tools".
  The "quartus programming tools" does not include tools to program/write the flash memory.
  You can use the "progrmming tools" package for only loading bitstreams but not reflashing.
  This web edition provides:
  -- quartus_pgm for programming via jtag
  -- sof2flash for converting bitstreams to flash format
  -- nios2-flash-programmer for programming flash via a bitstream with flash-writing support

Flash programming requires (at least) the platform's dev kit software, which includes:
  -- bitstream (.sof) and flash (.flash) files for factory default bitstreams.
  -- bitstream for indirectly writing flash
  -- the dev kits/boards come in different flavors for different Quartus versions
  -- the dev kits/boards come in different flavors for the part on the board (230 vs 530)
  -- the dev kits/boards are not available for the latest quartus versions
  ---- But since you are only using bitstreams, flash images, and doc:
  ------ its ok if the dev kit/board version is older than the tool version
  -- the dev kits/boards come only with Windows installers (xxx.exe).
  ---- Thus you must unpack on windows by running the xxx.exe file.
  ---- Then move the dir into your altera "kits" directory
  ---- E.g. your kit might be from 11.1, while your quartus install is under 13.1
  --- the result of installing a XXX kit is placed in:
  ----- <altera-dir>/kits/XXX
  -- Thus there is no provision for versioning the dev kits.

For installing the web edition for only this jtag and flash runtime support
(in this case on CentOS7 anyway, with 13.1):
  -- Download the tar file: Quartus-web-13.1.0.162.tar
  -- extract/unpack it somewhere temporary using: tar xf Quartus-web-13.1.0.162.tar
  -- this creates a file "setup.sh" and a directory "components"
  -- Run the install:  ./setup.sh
  -- This is a GUI installer/setup wizard.
  -- The default location of the installation is in your home directory, which is ok and
  ---- it does not require sudo for the installation
  -- To save space you can avoid the modelsim and the devices parts (checkboxes unchecked).

The enable OpenCPI to use all this, the location of the tools must be available to OpenCPI.
If the default locations is used, no environment variable settings are needed.
The default locations for <altera-dir>, defaults first to the "altera" directory in
your home directory since this is also the default location in the Altera installer.
If there is no such directory, /opt/Altera is used.  If you need to specify this explicitly
you can set the OCPI_ALTERA_DIR environment variable.

When using the "subscription" (i.e. licensed) edition of the Quartus tool (as opposed to the
web edition), you must have a license file.  The default name for this file is:
  Altera-License.lic
which is expected in the <altera-dir>.  If the name or directory of this file is
different, the OCPI_ALTERA_LICENSE_FILE environment variable can be set - either to a file
name without slashes (when it is in <altera-dir>) or an absolute pathname.

The Altera Quartus tools are expected to be found in a version directory under <altera-dir>
in a subdirectory named after a version e.g. 11.1 or 13.1.
The default version used is the latest one there.  If that is not desired, the OCPI_ALTERA_VERSION
environment variable may be set to override the default version determination.
The default installation of tools is <homedir>/altera/<version>/quartus...

If for some reasons you want to override the specific path to the tools (i.e. not using
<altera-dir>/<altera-version>), you can set the OCPI_ALTERA_TOOLS_DIR to the exact pathname of
Quartus tools.

For flash loading you must have the development kit for the particular development board.
These are expected to be found in the "kits" directory under <altera-dir>.
If the kits are not in that location you may use the OCPI_ALTERA_KITS_DIR environment variable
to indicate where they are.

Thus all these locations can use defaults with no environment variable settings, but these
environment variables can be used to override the defaults in different ways:

OCPI_ALTERA_DIR
OCPI_ALTERA_VERSION
OCPI_ALTERA_LICENSE_FILE
OCPI_ALTERA_TOOLS_DIR
OCPI_ALTERA_KITS_DIR

Here is an example of environment settings that override defaults:

export OCPI_ALTERA_TOOLS_DIR=/share/jim/altera/13.1
export OCPI_ALTERA_KITS_DIR=/share/jim/altera/11.1/kits
export OCPI_ALTERA_LICENSE_FILE=/shared/jim/mac/altera/1-9095JT_License.dat

To make the linux USB drivers work properly with the "USB Blaster" cable on the
Stratix4 dev board, you must place the file named "51-usbblaster.rules" in the
/etc/udev/rules.d directory.
(You must use "sudo cp" to put it there).  The contents of this file are: (between =====)
=====
# USB-Blaster
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="09fb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6001", MODE="0666"
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="09fb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6002", MODE="0666"
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="09fb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6003", MODE="0666"

# USB-Blaster II

BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="09fb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6010", MODE="0666"
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="09fb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6810", MODE="0666"
=====

If you put these lines above in a file "xx", the command to copy it to the right place is:

sudo cp xx /etc/udev/rules.d/51-usbblaster.rules

Reboot linux after placing this "51-usbblaster.rules" file in /etc/udev/rules.d.
(There might be a way of doing this without rebooting if you know how lots about udev).

Setting up the (stratix 4) dev board:

For the system that will run the board, you just need the "web edition" tools and the
"dev kit" files.  The standalone programming tools will allow bitstream loading, but not
flash memory reloading.

Assuming the tools are installed, and the jtag-usb programming cable is installed between
some USB port and the jtab usb port on the baord, use the following script to verify that
the jtag cable is working:

% probeJtag

This will use Altera software to find what jtab/usb cables exist, and what their
serial numbers are.  An example output is:

[jim@amd790 opencpi]$ probeJtag
==== Probing for Altera JTAG ports:
Found cable "USB-Blaster [USB 6-1]" with serial number "91d28408"
==== Probing for Xilinx JTAG ports:
Discovered ports are: usb21
Trying port usb21...USB Cable Connection verified on port usb21, ESN is 000013C1E1F401
Part at position 1 on usb21 is xccace
Part at position 2 on usb21 is xc6vlx240t

This shows that we have discovered an Altera jtag port named "USB-Blaster [USB 6-1]"
with a serial number of "91d28408".

When there is only one board for each vendor, the serial number is not needed,
but when there are more than one board, the serial number is used to uniquely associate
a board at a PCI device address with a jtag cable, in the file /opt/opencpi/system.xml.

The next (and last) step to the installation is to load an OpenCPI bitstream into the
flash memory of the board.

This is done with the loadFlash XXXX script, where XXXX is the name of the platform.
Use "alst4" for the s4gx230-based board, and "alst4x" for the s4gx530-based board.

So, assuming a s4gx530 board, assuming you had already built an opencpi bitstream
(like "tb_bias_v2" or "testbias"), you would do:

% loadFlash alstx <OpenCPI Bitstream File> <JTAG_CABLE_SERIAL_NUMBER>

The <JTAG_CABLE_SERIAL_NUMBER> can be "any" when there is only one cable.
OpenCPI bitstream files normally end in ".bitz".

This script converts the file to the format appropriate for flash,
loads a special factory bitstream via jtag that can help
(indirectly) write to flash, and then writes to flash.

After successfully writing to flash, the system should be POWERED DOWN
and then restarted. This is necessary to ensure that the bitstream
written to the flash is being used when the system is restarted.
When the system restarts:

1. Set up your environment by sourcing your env script
   (but using your script).

   % source jkvm6.sh

2. Load the OpenCPI linux kernel driver using "ocpidriver load".

   % ocpidriver load

3. Then using the OpenCPI command to find PCI devices running OpenCPI:

   % ocpihdl search

This last comment should print something like:

[jim@amd790 opencpi]$ ocpihdl search
OpenCPI HDL device found: 'PCI:0000:05:00.0': bitstream date Tue Dec 10 21:36:03 2013, platform "ml605", part "xc6vlx240t", UUID fa8cae9e-620c-11e3-9bbc-37ac85396832
OpenCPI HDL device found: 'PCI:0000:04:00.0': bitstream date Wed Dec 11 08:19:12 2013, platform "alst4x", part "ep4sgx530k", UUID d373720c-6266-11e3-8b4c-4399833db0a5

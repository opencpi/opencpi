  <!-- The MODE_p parameter just maps the above 4 booleans into 8 modes, which determine pin usage
       These modes are listed in the same order as the Digital Interface Specification section and Tables 48 and 50 in the
       reference manual (UG570), with swapped modes inserted.

    modes:                           P0[11:6] P0[5:0] P1[11:6] P1[5:0]
    CMOS:
      0. single port half duplex:    inout    inout   unused   unused
      1. ==same with SwapPorts       unused   unused  inout    inout
      2. single port full duplex:    out      in      unused   unused
      3. ==same with SwapPorts       unused   unused  out      in
      4. dual port half duplex:      inout    inout   inout    inout (swap is the same)
      5. dual port full duplex:      in       in      out      out

    LVDS:
      7. dual port full duplex:      out      out     in       in

    So the following expression just encodes the above table for convenience in setting the
    signal direction attributes.  Note mode 6 and 7 have identical signal directions but are
    still used to distinguish enabling LVDS

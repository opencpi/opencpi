           _____________________________|_____________________________
       It is important to note that the AD9361 datasheet specifies on p1. that
       the "maximum local oscillator (LO) step size" is 2.4 Hz. Further
       reading into the datasheet reveals that this value of 2.4 Hz is
       specific to an LO frequency of 2.4 GHz and a reference clock rate of 40
       MHz. On FMCOMMS2/3, a crystal clock source is used whose frequency is 40
       MHz, and as long as there is no external-to-the-FMCOMMS2/3 clock which
       drives the TP102 test point on the FMCOMMS2/3 PCB, it is a safe
       assumption that the reference clock rate matches that of the crystal.
       However, it is important to note that both RX and TX RF LO step sizes
       are in fact dependent upon the currently configured LO frequency. A
       correct interpretation of this would be "The closest achievable
       frequency_MHz values above or below the current frequency_MHz are the
       current value +/- frequency_step_MHz away." -->

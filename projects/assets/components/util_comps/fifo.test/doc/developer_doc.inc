\section*{Functionality}
\begin{flushleft}
  The FIFO component passes complex signed samples (Q0.15 I, Q0.15 Q) from the input port through a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer and onward to the output port. The depth, in number of complex samples, of the FIFO buffer is parameterized. This component includes a property-driven oneshot mode which, when enabled, allows the first FIFO depth number of samples to be sent to the output port and then discontinues data flow to the output port. After data flow is discontinued, the input port still ingests available samples, effectively operating as a data sink. This worker can also be parameterized to send a Zero-Length Message (ZLM) once data flow is discontinued.
\end{flushleft}

\section*{Worker Implementation Details}
\subsection*{\comp.hdl}
\begin{flushleft}
  In keeping with good data flow control practices, backpressure is transferred, when necessary, from the output port to the input port. Backpressure is never transferred when in oneshot mode and after the data flow is discontinued. Backpressure from the output port and forwardpressure from the input port are both alleviated by the FIFO buffer, with the degree of alleviation being directly proportional to the parameterized depth of the FIFO buffer (\verb+FIFO_DEPTH_p+).\medskip

  The input port's SOM, EOM, byte\_enable, and valid indicators are passed through the FIFO to the output port when data flow is allowed. Consequently, ZLMs will be passed through this worker. If operating in oneshot mode and data flow has been discontinued, the EOM will be set (i.e. logic value of 1 applied) on the same clock pulse as the last output sample.\medskip

  The \verb+ZLM_WHEN_ONESHOT_DONE_p+ parameter property, when having a value of true, forces the worker to send a single ZLM when in oneshot mode and data flow has been discontinued (i.e. when oneshot is 'done'). This is useful for allowing applications which use this worker to terminate once data flow is discontinued.

\section*{Test and Verification}
\begin{flushleft}
For verification, multiple test files are generated of varying lengths. Each test file is passed into the input port, and the output of the output port is saved to a file. The output file is compared against the input file to make sure they have the same binary contents and length. For the tests that use oneshot mode, the output file is only compared to the first min(input file size,8192) samples, with 8192 hardcoded to correspond to \verb+FIFO_DEPTH_p+.

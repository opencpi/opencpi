ZLM\_WHEN\_ONESHOT\_DONE\_p & bool & - & - &  & Standard & false & When true, worker will generate Zero-Length-Message after oneshot was enabled and completed.\\
\hline
oneshot & bool & - & - & Readable, Initial & Standard & false & If false, the FIFO operates normally, i.e. it allows data to flow from adc\_in to adc\_passthrough\_out and transfers backpressure accordingly. If true, the functionality is as follows. The FIFO receives data from adc\_in and holds it until the FIFO is full. One the FIFO is full, data is pulled from the FIFO and sent out the adc\_passthrough\_out port, all the while data is pulled from adc\_in but unused, effectively making the adc\_in port a data sink. Note that a control plane reset will always reset the FIFO and start this operation over.\\

The socket library used by this worker is "asio" which is the Boost ASIO library with less
dependencies on Boost. It would be totally independent if we had full C++11 capabilities,
but some ARM compilers (e.g. picoflexor) only support up to GCC 4.4, which has certain
limitations (cf. https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/cxx0x_status.html and
https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx11 ).

So, I downloaded "asio-1.10.6" from http://think-async.com/Asio/ (well, SourceForge) and
checked in a stripped-down version of only the include/ subdir and needed configuration
files. Since it is header only, I use the boost headers included on the base system even
for cross-compiling. Any editing I had to do will have "#AV" comments to easily find.

The library should auto-configure using "Makefile.av" and rules in this directory's
Makefile. However, to manually configure the library, go to the asio subdir and run:
./av-reconf
./av-configure (for host) OR ./picoflexor-configure (for pf) OR
  ./configure --with-boost=$(pwd)/local_boost --host=your-crosshost-prefix-here

The source code from src/examples/cpp03/http/server was then taken and modified to
provide certain classes (e.g. connection). Being derivative works, they fall under the
BOOST 1.0 License and NOT the LGPL License as the rest of this project. However, the Boost
license is considered LESS restrictive, so this should be of no concern. The modified version
can be found in ext_src/ .

To add a new platform, RccOnlyPlatforms in the Makefile should be expanded, as well as the
platform-specific flags added to the Makefile to designate if the build is boost-based, etc.

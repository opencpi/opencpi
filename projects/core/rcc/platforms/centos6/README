This directory contains information and scripts for installing and building
OpenCPI for CentOS6. Look at the readme files for:

1. Install - things you must do *before* building OpenCPI infrastructure, components and apps.
2. Build - how to actually build all of OpenCPI.
3. Setup - things to do after building in order to use the platform to run apps.

[This information is incomplete at this time, but the OpenCPI Installation Manual,
in doc/OpenCPI_Installation.pdf, includes all the pertinent information]

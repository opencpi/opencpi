    * Used to flush a transmit data chain.  The way this is expected to work is an out of band flush 
    * property will need to be set on a DAC component to tell the DAC to ignore all data until a flush 
    * operation is received in the transmit stream.  The property on the DAC component will be a 
    * boolean that internally to the DAC component will increment a counter and when the flush 
    * operation hits the DAC this counter is decremented.  When the counter non-zero ignore all data 
    * coming in and when is zero output data to the DAC.  This is an advanced option and may not be    
    * used by all applications but this message should be passed on by all workers in the data stream.

  <!-- 
    * Used to signify a discontinuity in data.  Filters may need to be reset in this case.  This opcode 
    * would be generated by whichever worker generates the data in the stream.  This is an advanced

    * workers in the data stream.

  <!-- 
    * Used to signify end of data stream, used instead of zero length messages to set all workers in 
    * the stream to done.  This opcode would be generated by whichever worker generates the data in the 
    * stream. This message should be passed on by all workers in the data stream.

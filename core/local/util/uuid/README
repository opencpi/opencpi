This directory came from the uuid-1.6.2 from the The OSSP Project <http://www.ossp.org/>
It is here just to allow standalone building, and may be removed in order to
build directly against standard packages that are preinstalled on a system to save space.

centos6: -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -fPIC -DPIC
mac: -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -fno-common -DPIC

Changed from the original:
Moved uuid.h to from src/ to include/
Renamed uuic_cli.c to uuid_cli.c.hold to avoid a main program we don't need
In config.h:

#ifdef __APPLE__
#define HAVE_NET_IF_DL_H 1
#define HAVE_SYS_SOCKIO_H 1
#else
#define HAVE_LIBNSL 1
#endif
#define _BSD_SOURCE 1 /* necessary since we now use -std=c99 */
#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 199309L /* necessary since we now use -std=c99 */
